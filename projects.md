# Research

**[No Buck for the Bang: Revisiting the Military-Growth Nexus](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3063375)**, _Empirica_, with Serhan Cevik

This paper investigates the empirical relationship between military spending and economic growth in a large panel of advanced and developing countries over the period 1984–2014, with a particular focus on whether the growth impact of military expenditures varies with the type and level of security threats. Although there is extensive literature on the military-growth nexus, there is still no consensus on the nature and magnitude of this relationship. Using an expansive dataset and controlling for country-specific effects and potential endogeneity, we revisit this issue and reach two firm conclusions. First, military spending has no statistically significant direct (positive) effect on growth. Second, the nature and level of security threats do not alter the relationship between military spending and growth. Overall, the empirical results documented in the study suggest that military spending is simply not important or large enough in most countries to have a meaningful impact on growth.

**[Fiscal consequences of
terrorism](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2015/wp15225.pdf)**,
_IMF working paper series_, with Serhan Cevik

This paper provides an empirical analysis of how the frequency and
severity of terrorism affect government revenue and expenditure during
the period 1970–2013 using a panel dataset on 153 countries. We find
that terrorism has only a marginal negative effect on tax revenue
performance, after controlling for economic and institutional factors.
This effect is also not robust to alternative specifications and
empirical strategies. On the other hand, we find strong evidence that
terrorism is associated with an increase in military spending as a
percent of GDP (and a share of total government expenditure). Our
estimations reveal that this impact is greater when terrorist attacks
are frequent and result in a large number of fatalities. Empirical
findings also support the view that public finances in developing and
low-income countries are more vulnerable to terrorism than those in
countries that are richer and diversified.

**[Do food stamps crowd out contributions to food-related charities?](http://www.antolin-davies.com/theses/ricco.pdf)**, _Duquesne senior thesis_

Previous studies indicate that welfare benefits partially crowd out charity. This research,
however, does not present a thorough analysis of non-religious charities and does not
disaggregate welfare benefits into specific programs. To address these two shortcomings, I
exploit a provision of the 1996 welfare reform law to identify the causal impact of food stamps on contributions to food-related charities. The results suggest that the crowd-out effect
was between 7 and 16 cents on the dollar in counties with active food-related charities. This
finding is robust to a variety of specifications.

# Writing samples

I blog occasionally for the DC-area urbanism website [Greater Greater Washington](https://ggwash.org/contributors/jricco). I've explored topics like housing production, comparative land use policy, and transit construction costs in a conversational and explanatory tone. My posts have been cited by think tanks such as the [Urban Institute](http://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/83656/2000907-strategies-for-increasing-housing-supply-in-high-cost-cities-dc-case-study_1.pdf) and [City Observatory](http://cityobservatory.org/you-need-more-than-one-number-to-understand-housing-affordability/).

# Selected personal projects

**[@everylotphilly](https://twitter.com/everylotphilly)**

A Twitter bot that posts images of every single property in Philadelphia. The bot is an instance of Neil Freeman's [everylot Python library](https://github.com/fitnr/everylotbot), which combines tax records, APIs from Google and Twitter, and cloud computing to create, [in his words](http://fakeisthenewreal.org/everylot/): 

>a totalizing view of city. Google has cars, cameras, and computation; the City has tax clerks, history and legal authority. These two mapping systems are vast and difficult to visualize. By pairing them, the bots reveal moments of disharmony in the two approaches. 

This account was profiled at [Philly Voice](http://www.phillyvoice.com/twitter-account-perfect-philly-property-nerds/). It will take nearly 21 years to cover the entire city.
