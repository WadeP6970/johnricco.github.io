title: About me
---

Hello! My name is John. I live in Philadelphia and do data work for the Public Policy Initiative at Wharton. In the past I've worked at the IMF, and at a data consultancy in Pittsburgh.

My interests include public policy and statistical programming. I'm especially passionate about US urban policy -- specifically housing costs, mass transit, and neighborhood change.
