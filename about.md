title: About me
---

Hello! My name is John. I live in Washington, DC and work as a research analyst for the IMF. Prior to joining the Fund, I studied economics at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh.

My interests include public policy (specifically: urban economics, mass transit, and public finance), statistical programming, and data visualization. I've recently co-authored an [IMF working paper](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2015/wp15225.pdf) and produced a number of interactive data visualizations for the popular DC blog [Greater Greater Washington.](http://greatergreaterwashington.org/jricco/) For more information on my professional background and skills, you can find my resume [here]("http://johnricco.github.io/resume/").
