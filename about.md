title: About me

Hello! My name is John. I live in Philadelphia and do tax modeling for the Penn Wharton Budget Model. In the past I've worked at the IMF, and at a data consultancy in Pittsburgh.

I spend a lot of time thinking about public policy issues -- mostly related to taxation, housing policy, and gentrification. I also really, _really_ like to surf.
