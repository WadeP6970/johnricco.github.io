post title: The quiet density that illegal neighborhoods afford 
---

One of my favorite ideas to come from the smart folks at City
Observatory is the "illegal neighborhood": those beloved urban places
that developed before onerous land use regulation made them literally
illegal to build. I think the term gets at the essence of the issue in a way that urbanists aren't always great at communicating. 

Another thing that illegal neighborhoods are sneakily good at providing? Density.
