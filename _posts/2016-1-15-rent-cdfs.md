title: Interactive CDFs of rent per bedroom 
---

A few months ago, I used census survey data to create an interactive
graph of rent distributions in American urban areas. Though useful, the
data have three major issues:

* Because household-level data isn't available, I used ZIP code to
construct the CDFs. This aggregation hides variation we might be
interested in. 

* The gross rent figures aren't broken down by bedroom,
so to the extent that there are meaningful geographic differences in
housing characteristics (e.g. NYC probably has a higher share of studios than Pittsburgh),
the CDFs aren't quite comparable across cities. 

* The ZIP-level data are cut off at $2000. This is too low a cutoff for expensive cities.

Fortunately, Shawn Bucholtz of HUD took notice of my post and was kind enough to send me internal data that addresses all three of my concerns -- and so I re-created the graph with the new data. 

Embedded below is a graph with a subsample of some of America's largest urban areas. The full interactive version where you can choose from 40 urban areas is here.
